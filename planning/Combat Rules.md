- **Bear-Criminal Meter**:
    
    - Displayed as a sliding meter with values for Bear on one side and Criminal on the other:
        - **Bear**: 1 2 3 **4** 5
        - **Crim**: 5 4 3 **2** 1
    - The meter has an oval that highlights a Bear value and a corresponding Criminal value. The combined values always add up to 6.
    - **Slider Movement**:
        - **Greed**: Successful actions (Bear or Criminal) move the slider one step to the left (toward Bear).
        - **Frustration**: Unsuccessful actions move the slider one step to the right (toward Criminal).
    - Success or failure of actions is determined by a dice roll, where the result must be below the corresponding Bear or Criminal number. The further below the number, the better the result; the further above, the worse the outcome.
    - **Risk of Maul**: A failed Maul attack shifts the slider heavily towards Bear.
- **Game Over Conditions**:
    
    - The player loses if:
        - They go full Bear (the slider maxes out on the Bear side).
        - They go full Criminal (the slider maxes out on the Criminal side).
        - They lose all HP.
